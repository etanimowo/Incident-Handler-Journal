# Incident-Handler-Journal

# Project: Documenting an Incident with an Incident Handler's Journal

# Overview
In this project, I documented a security incident using an incident handler's journal. This activity emphasized the importance of accurate and thorough documentation in incident response. By recording details systematically, I ensured that no critical information was lost and that the journal could serve as a reference for future investigations.

# Scenario
The incident involved a ransomware attack affecting company systems. The journal entry was dated, numbered, and provided a brief description of the scenario. The documentation captured the sequence of events and initial observations.

# The 5 W's
In the journal entry, I addressed the following questions:
- Who: Identified the person or system responsible for the incident.
- What: Described the nature of the incident, including ransomware infection.
- When: Recorded the exact date and time of occurrence.
- Where: Specified the location of the affected systems or network.
- Why: Noted any contributing factors or reasons why the incident occurred.

# Additional Notes
The journal included additional questions and observations about the incident, such as:

- Immediate containment steps taken.
- Initial impact assessment.
- Communication with affected stakeholders.
- Any preliminary findings that could assist with remediation.

# What This Project Taught Me
- The importance of detailed and structured incident documentation.
- How to apply the 5 W's to capture the critical aspects of a security incident.
- How an incident handler's journal can support future investigations and response planning.
- Best practices for maintaining accurate records during high-pressure incident response scenarios.

# Skills I Acquired
- Incident documentation and record-keeping.
- Analytical thinking to capture key details and patterns.
- Communication of technical findings in a clear and organized manner.
- Incident response procedures and observation tracking.
- Reference creation for ongoing and future security incidents.
